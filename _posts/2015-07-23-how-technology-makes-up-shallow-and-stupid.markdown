GMail's Compose window - quite like my bank balance - keeps getting smaller with every iteration. It makes sense. After all, who writes long e-mails these days? It's funny really - sometimes I'll get a mail from someone that spans just over three paragraphs - and they apologize for the long mail.

You could, of course, argue that we don't *need* to send long emails - because we have better communication channels - like Skype/Hangouts/WhatsApp and the like. Yes, you would be correct. But ask yourself when was the last time you had a long, meaningful conversation with a friend over Skype? When did you have a lengthy discussion about the latest Marvel movie, the last cricket match, or depending on your age, about work, politics, religion or your bowel movement over Hangouts?

## The problem with always being Online
Back in the old days, you would explicitly go online and sign-in to an instant messenger. It was an elaborate ritual that involved booting up your computer, clicking on the Internet icon, the dial-up modem making beeps (and you mouthing along), and finally clicking on ICQ or AIM. You would see that most of your buddies are offline, and a couple of them online. You would write "Hi" to someone, and they would reply. And you would continue chatting for a few minutes or even a few hours.

These days, everyone is always online. If you say "Hi" to someone, chances are, they will be busy. They will reply after a few hours. And that's when you will be busy. Conversations become short and meaningless.

I find that this is pretty much the same with telephone calls. "Hey, I gotto run. Will talk to you later!"

## Your awesome breakfast this morning
Don't you want to share that on Facebook? Check-in to that restaurant? Tell all the people how amazing your life is? About how you're feeling sad or happy or excited today? Oh, but how could I forget about the *Send this to 10 people for good luck* posts. Or about how Mars is going to be bigger than the moon. (Seriously, to the people who post that: Your mom is bigger than the moon).

Try sharing something that triggers a discussion, and see how quickly the trolls take over.

## A solution
While instant messaging and social media do have their advantages, what is missing is the ability to have long, meaningful discussions with your friends. The telephone is a good option, provided you can decide a on a time. For people staying far away in different time zones, this would be difficult.

The solution, I believe, is what people have been doing since a long, long time - writing letters. Of course, you would e-mail them rather than having them go through the alimentary canal that is our postal system.

But then again, perhaps I am one of the few people who sees this as a problem that needs solving. Most people I know are perfectly content with sharing their short, poorly-worded life experiences over Facebook.

However, if you do agree with this post, I encourage you to start writing to people. As for the rest of you, get off my lawn!
